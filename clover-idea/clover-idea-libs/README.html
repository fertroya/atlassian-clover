  <h2>What's this</h2>

  <p>This module contains third party libraries taken out from Intellij IDEA installations. They are being used
  for unit testing. Keep here the latest patch version of every IDEA product line supported.
  </p>

  <h2>Maintenance</h2>

  <p>Since IDEA12 the Apache Commons Collections (commons-collections.jar) is not included in the IDEA/lib directory.
  Therefore we're packaging Collections library into clover-idea.jar using a repackaged version ('clover.' namespace
  prefix added) of clover-commons-collections.jar.</p>
